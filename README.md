# Leveraging the VQ-VAE Model to Analyze Missing Not at Random Patterns in Behavioral Data 
Missing data is one of the most common artifacts in real-world datasets, appearing in a wide variety of contexts, that pose challenges for effective data analysis. As such, modeling missing data can potentially reveal further insights which can be instrumental in improving the quality of datasets. In recent years, probabilistic deep generative models have shown great potential in modeling the intricate structure of complex data. However, most of these either disregard the missigness masks or use them solely as a proxy to model the underlying dataset. We believe that directly modeling the missing data can offer deeper insights and generate informative latent representations that prove valuable for downstream tasks. Here, we propose training a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to model missingness masks using discrete latent codes. Furthermore, we combine the trained VQ-VAE model with a powerful PixelCNN prior to achieve forecasting of missingness patterns. For these purposes, the developed model is evaluated using a human passive monitoring dataset derived from mobile and wearable devices.
